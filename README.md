## Brief
In the era of digital information, efficient processing of textual data has become essential. This project uses ML techniques to classify Myanmar news articles into four categoriesâ€”Politics, Entertainment, Crime, and Business. The dataset comprises 720 articles, preprocessed using tokenization and stopword removal. Classification experiments employ an RBF Support Vector Machine (SVM) with vectorization techniques, achieving an 83% accuracy using TF-IDF vectorization. For summarization, both extractive and abstractive approaches are explored. Extractive summarization utilizes cosine similarity and the TextRank algorithm, while abstractive summarization leverages the transformer-based mT-5 model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy for classification and ROUGE scores for summarization validate the system's effectiveness.

## Dataset
- For Myanmar News Classification, **720 news articles** from four categories **(Politics, Entertainment, Crime, and Business)** were collected, segmented into sentences to solve class imbalance, and split into 6,769 training and 1,695 testing sentences using an 80-20 ratio.
- For Summarization, the **XL-Sum dataset**, featuring professionally annotated article-summary pairs in 45 languages, was used, with 5,761 training articles and 719 each for development and testing in the Myanmar language.
